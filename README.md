# About
I have made several 'flavours' of access available for those who are interested. 
- **Code I Wrote** includes *only* the files that were written solely by myself
- **All Code** includes *all* .cpp and .h files used to create the project. I have contributed heavily to *Characters*, *Fighter*, 
  *gameplayengine* and *game_loops*.
- **345dnd.zip** is a full compilation of all resources required to compile and run the project
